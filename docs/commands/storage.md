```bash
tauri-agent-tools storage

```
localStorage (3 entries)
  theme = "dark"
  language = "en"
  sidebar_collapsed = "true"

sessionStorage (1 entry)
  active_tab = "settings"

cookies (2 entries)
  session_id = "abc123"
  preferences = "compact"
```

### Show only localStorage

```bash
tauri-agent-tools storage --type local

```bash
tauri-agent-tools storage --key theme

```
localStorage: dark
```

### JSON output

```bash
tauri-agent-tools storage --json
```

```json
{
  "localStorage": [
    { "key": "theme", "value": "dark" },
    { "key": "language", "value": "en" }
  ],
  "sessionStorage": [],
  "cookies": [
    { "key": "session_id", "value": "abc123" }
  ]
}
```

## Notes

- This is a one-shot read — storage is read once and displayed
- Cookie access is limited to `document.cookie` (HttpOnly cookies are not visible)
- When using `--key`, the value is looked up in all selected storage types
